# PDFSplitMerger
Split and merge pdf files. Three functionalities: merge multiple pdfs into one, split single pdf by page and an option to cut each page in half (useful for fixing scanned files).

Uses podofo for the pdf library and Qt as the GUI. 
podofo 0.9.3
http://podofo.sourceforge.net/
Qt 5.5
http://www.qt.io/qt-framework/


# Linux
Built on Ubuntu 13.04 using QtCreator/g++. Please compile podofo first.
Also check bin for compiled binaries/libraries on Ubuntu 13.04.

# Windows
I could not get podofo to compile and function correctly on windows. Mingw compiled library does not pass all the given tests. Compiling on visual studio seems way too tedious.
